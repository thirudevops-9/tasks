Q: launching the one instance using aws ec2 macine 

ans : 


     loging to aws account and go to ec2 machine 

here selcet #ec2 dash board 
	    #runninig instance 
	    #launching instance 
	    #here selcet whhat you need launching instance name and serch after that go to the selcet ot entre
	     imp:you have to cross check wheather instance is free or cost,if there is free can you procede
	    #configure to instance
		here no change any data 
	    #add storage
		here how much volume spaace would you selcet  
   	    #add tages	
		agian add tags select 
 		  here change the some data that is 	
		key		volume
		Name		webserver
		environment	labs

 	#launch instance
	#view instance	

now are you sucussfully launching the webserver instance 



task 2: how to create snapshot 
	 
	#go to ec2 dashboard

	4)nagios
Q:when i hearing the essential how many calculate the clode watch 
ans:	1)essential
	2)associative
	3)architecture

NOTE :
	here you will get instance id,that id will generated by automatically aws will create
